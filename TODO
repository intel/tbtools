 tbtools
 -------
 - support for vendor specific registers (e.g registers-intel.json)
 - tbmand - a "web server" version of tbman (REST API or so). Allows
            more complex graphics for device topology etc through HTML5
	    but still should work on minimal userspace (for example buildroot)

 tbman
 -----
 - full tunnel viewer + DP (bw management) stuff
 - NVM access
 - log viewer (for example show logs for this device)
 - lane margining
 - filtering to tracing

tbtrace
-------
 - compliance - a command that looks for accesses outside of spec
   specified register access. For example writing to HopIDs of protocol
   adapters and lane 1 adapter access of USB4 v2 routers, and so on.
