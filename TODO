 tbtools
 -------
 - tbmand - a "web server" version of tbman (REST API or so). Allows
            more complex graphics for device topology etc through HTML5
	    but still should work on minimal userspace (for example buildroot)
- sideband register support
- DMA test (dma_test.ko) support. Probably some sort of script that runs
  it automatically or so.

 tbman
 -----
 - full tunnel viewer + DP (bw management) stuff
 - NVM access
 - log viewer (for example show logs for this device)
 - lane margining
 - filtering to tracing
